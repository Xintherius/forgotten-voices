# Message from developers:
Thank you for downloading Forgotten Voices

# Summary:
Forgotten Voices is a mix between Undertale and Celeste, platforms and role-play. In this story you're Juanchito, a young adult in a post-apocalyptic world set in the middle ages. They're burning sick people on the streets and you're the only one that can do something about it.

If you're reading this is because you downloaded the Demo of the game, please support us with an upvote to release the game on Steam.
